jsring - A toy ring buffer
==========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/johannes/jsring.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/johannes/jsring)

This is a simple implementation of a ring buffer with a compile-time defined size. This is an weekend afternoon hack and not supposed to be used in production. There certainly are more robust/efficient/... implementations.

Usage
-----

```c++
#include <jsring.h>
#include <iostream>

jsring::ring<int, 10> ring{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
ring.push_back(11);
ring.push_back(12);
ring.push_front(0);

for (auto i : ring) {
  std::cout << i << " ";
}
std::cout << '\n';
```

This will print

    0 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

See the [tests](test/main.cpp) for more examples.

Installation
------------

All code is included in `include/jsring.h`. Also a `CMakeLists.txt` is provided which allows installation using CMake. After installing other projects can add a dependency via

```cmake
find_package(jsring CONFIG REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(YourApp jsring)
```

Tests are using GTest. CMake will load this dependency when needed.
